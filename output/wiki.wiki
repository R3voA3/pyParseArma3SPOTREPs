Motivation: These classes were not used by default soldier load-outs and we deemed them unnecessary. Some of them used wrong optics for the given side of the weapon, some didn't make any sense. We would like to encourage adding different weapons rather via scripting and specific add-ons to them than having bazillions of pre-defined guns few people are likely to use and we cannot maintain quality control on them all.
Renamed config classes:
* arifle_Khaybar_C_ACOg_point_F -&gt; arifle_Katiba_C_ACO_pointer_F
* arifle_Khaybar_C_ACOg_F -&gt; arifle_Katiba_C_ACO_F

* arifle_MX_ACO_pointer_F
* arifle_MX_point_F -&gt; arifle_MX_pointer_F
* arifle_MX_Holo_point_F -&gt; arifle_MX_Holo_pointer_F
* arifle_MX_Hamr_point_F -&gt; arifle_MX_Hamr_pointer_F
* arifle_MX_ACO_point_F -&gt; arifle_MX_ACO_pointer_F
* arifle_MX_GL_ACO_point_F -&gt; arifle_MX_GL_ACO_pointer_F

* srifle_EBR_ACOg_point_F -&gt; srifle_EBR_ACO_pointer_F
* srifle_EBR_Mark_F -&gt; srifle_EBR_MRCO_pointer_F
Motivation: Weapon class names have been unified across the whole scale of weapons to be more consistent with the rest of game. There is no need to differentiate ACO colors in the class name of the weapon because each weapon is given only to specific side which use some color of ACO.

* B_Mk6Mortar_Support -&gt; B_Mortar_01_support_F
* B_Mk6Mortar_Wpn -&gt; B_Mortar_01_weapon_F
Motivation: We decided to change class names of vehicles to more generic ones to support possible renaming (as it may be seen on some assets) and easier mission scripting. It should be easier for mission maker to simply add a MRAP by describing it in class name rather to remember all the names of assets.

** BIS_fnc_cinemaBorder
** and
** BIS_fnc_quotations
** to support stacking of disabled save games
** Modified all “Survive” missions to support new stacked handling of disabled saving
* Continued work upon soldier protection:
** Slightly decreased collateral resistance of OPFOR soldiers’ extremities
** Decreased OPFOR advanced uniform protectiveness of extremities for it was too powerful. Still, it protects comparatively better than other uniforms.
** Set up specific protection values for BLUFOR Helipilot and Pilot coveralls. It will not save you much more than the standard uniform, but there is a certain difference.
** Set up proper protection values for OPFOR Officer uniform
** Range-master belt, bandoleer and chest-rig armor values set to zero (serving as just equipment holders)
** Tweaked helmet protection levels
** Minor tweaks in ammunition, precise adjusting of
** minimalHitRange
** values, damage scaling rounds up, pistol ammunition damage adjustments and grenade tweaks
** Adjusted explosives to maintain the protection of grenadier vests against explosives and grenades
** Minor changes in soldier equipment due to changes in headgear. Purpose of classes is not affected in any meaningful manner.
** Impacts of bullets cause soldiers to ragdoll a bit (flinch) even if they are fully absorbed by armor
** Decreased overall helmet protection values to increase significance of head-shots and general lethality of damage to the head
** Increased density of soldiers’ bodies to improve headshot lethality
** Because of the previous change it was also necessary to halve the explosion shielding of head hitpoint in general to maintain helmet protection levels for collateral indirect damage and explosions
** Fixed HE grenade from underbarrel GL weapon to match his RGO Frag grenade counterpart
** Elevated OPFOR collateral protection for hands and legs for the previous values were not sufficient to create meaningful difference between OPFOR and soldiers of other factions
* Mk20 rifle now has correct zeroing steps of iron sights
* Fixed: Possible issues with cinema border function being called badly
* Engineer should be no longer stuck after repairing a vehicle

* Updated ammo boxes load-outs:

* Fixed: RPT spam of "weapon:"?" with ? modes needs weapon mode with index ?, but given silencer ( ? ) has only ? modes" by adding a specific suppressor for MX SW
* Fixed: Offroad braking on its own too much
* Fixed: Players should now be able to distinguish AH-99 'Blackfoot' as itself, not just as a 'Helicopter'
* Fixed: Casings from Ghosthawk's left gun are no longer ejected from the right gun ( <a href="http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=17621" target="_blank"> http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=17621 </a>)\n* Animals should have textures even when not local in MP

=== NOTES ===
* Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
* Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.
* Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank"> Dev Hub </a>
* . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank"> Release Candidate tests </a>
* . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
* A
* Legacy Build
* Steam branch is available for advanced users. It contains the previous significant main branch version (1.62). It can be used to compare specific changes between major releases. The access code for this branch is:
* Arma3Legacy162

* ACTIVITY: Game Update 1.94 (Contact Expansion, Livonia Terrain, Platform Assets)
* SIZE: ~10.2 GB / ~1.6 GB (depends on Contact ownership)

=== NOTES ===

* Contact (Platform): for most other use cases, including sandbox multiplayer (loaded by default for all players)
* Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
* Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.
* Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank"> Dev Hub </a>
* . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank"> Release Candidate tests </a>
* . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
* A Legacy Build Steam branch is available for advanced users. It contains the previous significant main branch version (1.92). It can be used to compare specific changes between major releases. The access code for this branch is: Arma3Legacy192
* This update does not apply to <a href="http://dev.arma3.com/ports" target="_blank"> the experimental Linux and Mac port betas </a>
* .
* You can find the servers in the Steam library (switch the filter to "Tools") - "Arma 3 Server" (based on your OS, it will download the Windows or Linux version).
* Administrators can also use the command-line <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD" target="_blank"> SteamCMD </a>
* utility. The app ID is to be 233780.

This data is signed by a new A3C key whose presence can be used to control what client data is allowed on the server
** Known issue: Steam client modifies the
** steam_appid.txt
** file incorrectly. In case of issues, verify its content is:
* '''107410'''
** Known issue: Sometimes the add-ons are loaded from the wrong installation (e.g. main game)
