    Steam Workshop version
   </a>
   of the "Old Man" scenario. It contained the beta version, but an improved version has now been integrated into the vanilla platform. The Workshop item will no longer contain game data (to avoid conflicts), but is no longer necessary for anybody.
  </li>
  <li>
   Contact consists of 2 data packs / folders:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contact (via PLAY CONTACT or -mod=Contact): for the singleplayer "First Contact" campaign experience (accessible only to owners - optionally loaded)
    </li>
    <li>
     Contact (Platform): for most other use cases, including sandbox multiplayer (loaded by default for all players)
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.
  </li>
  <li>
   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our Release Candidate tests. Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
  </li>

   A Legacy Build Steam branch is available for advanced users. It contains the previous significant main branch version (1.96). It can be used to compare specific changes between major releases. The access code for this branch is: Arma3Legacy196
