Motivation: These classes were not used by default soldier load-outs and we deemed them unnecessary. Some of them used wrong optics for the given side of the weapon, some didn't make any sense. We would like to encourage adding different weapons rather via scripting and specific add-ons to them than having bazillions of pre-defined guns few people are likely to use and we cannot maintain quality control on them all.
Renamed config classes:
* arifle_Khaybar_C_ACOg_point_F -&gt; arifle_Katiba_C_ACO_pointer_F

* srifle_EBR_Mark_F -&gt; srifle_EBR_MRCO_pointer_F
Motivation: Weapon class names have been unified across the whole scale of weapons to be more consistent with the rest of game. There is no need to differentiate ACO colors in the class name of the weapon because each weapon is given only to specific side which use some color of ACO.

* B_Mk6Mortar_Wpn -&gt; B_Mortar_01_weapon_F
Motivation: We decided to change class names of vehicles to more generic ones to support possible renaming (as it may be seen on some assets) and easier mission scripting. It should be easier for mission maker to simply add a MRAP by describing it in class name rather to remember all the names of assets.
