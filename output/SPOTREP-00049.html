   Tweaked: The projectile spawning module script (used for example by the Ordnance module) will no longer attempt to show
   <a href="https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Zeus" target="_blank">
    Zeus
   </a>
   hints when no Zeus owns the module
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: All supply (rearm, refuel &amp; repair) trucks and sling loadable supply containers (with exception of the vehicle ammo crate) are now effectively inexhaustible. However, fuel and ammo supply death explosions now destroy anything in their supply radius (10 meters). This is supposed to overcome issues with limited supply capacity and with repeated resupplying of the supply trucks and containers. All the respective scripting commands work as before, as the respective supply parameters were simply increased by several orders of magnitude.
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Collision models and rotation axis for turning animations of characters
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Decreased direct hit damage of 120mm and 125mm High Explosive shells for they were too effective even against heavily armored vehicles. Explosive splash damage remains unchanged though.
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Geometry for unarmed characters
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Smoothed out the motion in the upper body and head in the running forward relaxed animation

   scenarios now use server param
   <em>
    'Respawn Tickets'
