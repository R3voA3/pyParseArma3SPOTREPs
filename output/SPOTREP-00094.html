    Steam Workshop version
   </a>
   of the "Old Man" scenario. It contained the beta version, but an improved version has now been integrated into the vanilla platform. The Workshop item no longer contains game data (to avoid conflicts), and is no longer necessary for anybody.

  <li>
   Contact consists of 2 data packs / folders:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Contact (via
     <i>
      PLAY CONTACT
     </i>
     or
     <i>
      -mod=Contact
     </i>
     ): for the singleplayer "First Contact" campaign experience (accessible only to owners - optionally loaded)
    </li>
    <li>
     Contact (Platform): for most other use cases, including sandbox multiplayer (loaded by default for all players)
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.

  <li>
   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

  </li>
  <li>
   Fixed: Incorrectly referenced string in the Old Man Welcome Screen
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: "Old Man" saves could grow massively and should now do so less for new play-throughs (we hope to also provide an experimental fix to those with broken saves in another branch)
   <br/>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2>
  ENGINE
  <br/>
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Fixed: Severe cases of multiplayer vehicle desync after the recent update (thanks for your testing of various solutions)

     The data in
     <i>
      -mod=contact

     is not fully multiplayer compatible (it is meant for the singleplayer campaign experience); we recommend only hosting servers with it for special use cases
     <ul>
      <li>
       This data is signed by a new A3C key whose presence can be used to control what client data is allowed on the server
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Known issue: Steam client modifies the
     <i>
      steam_appid.txt
     </i>
     file incorrectly. In case of issues, verify its content is:
     <b>
      107410
     </b>
    </li>
    <li>
     Known issue: Sometimes the add-ons are loaded from the wrong installation (e.g. main game)
    </li>
    <li>
     Try adding
     <i>
      -mod=curator;kart;heli;mark;expansion;jets;argo;orange;tacops;tank;enoch
