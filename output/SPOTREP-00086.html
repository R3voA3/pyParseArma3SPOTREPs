   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
