    <li>
     Modified all “Survive” missions to support new stacked handling of disabled saving

   Continued work upon soldier protection:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Slightly decreased collateral resistance of OPFOR soldiers’ extremities
    </li>
    <li>
     Decreased OPFOR advanced uniform protectiveness of extremities for it was too powerful. Still, it protects comparatively better than other uniforms.
    </li>
    <li>
     Set up specific protection values for BLUFOR Helipilot and Pilot coveralls. It will not save you much more than the standard uniform, but there is a certain difference.
    </li>
    <li>
     Set up proper protection values for OPFOR Officer uniform
    </li>
    <li>
     Range-master belt, bandoleer and chest-rig armor values set to zero (serving as just equipment holders)

    <li>
     Tweaked helmet protection levels
    </li>
    <li>

      minimalHitRange
     </em>
     values, damage scaling rounds up, pistol ammunition damage adjustments and grenade tweaks

    <li>
     Adjusted explosives to maintain the protection of grenadier vests against explosives and grenades
    </li>
    <li>
     Minor changes in soldier equipment due to changes in headgear. Purpose of classes is not affected in any meaningful manner.
    </li>
    <li>
     Impacts of bullets cause soldiers to ragdoll a bit (flinch) even if they are fully absorbed by armor
    </li>
    <li>
     Decreased overall helmet protection values to increase significance of head-shots and general lethality of damage to the head
    </li>
    <li>
     Increased density of soldiers’ bodies to improve headshot lethality
    </li>
    <li>
     Because of the previous change it was also necessary to halve the explosion shielding of head hitpoint in general to maintain helmet protection levels for collateral indirect damage and explosions
    </li>
    <li>
     Fixed HE grenade from underbarrel GL weapon to match his RGO Frag grenade counterpart
    </li>
    <li>
     Elevated OPFOR collateral protection for hands and legs for the previous values were not sufficient to create meaningful difference between OPFOR and soldiers of other factions
    </li>

  </li>
  <li>
