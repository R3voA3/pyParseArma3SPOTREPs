  <li>
   Variable
   <em>
    BIS_fnc_advHint_state
   </em>
   (missionNameSpace) contains info about the currently displayed advanced hint
  </li>
  <li>
   Decreased triggerTime of Minigun ammo. Also removed explosive effects from 7.62mm Minigun ammo that were inevitably inherited from SubmunitionBase class of ammo (AH-9 minigun should behave well yet again)
