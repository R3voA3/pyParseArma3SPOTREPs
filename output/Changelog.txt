 <p>
  Motivation: These classes were not used by default soldier load-outs and we deemed them unnecessary. Some of them used wrong optics for the given side of the weapon, some didn't make any sense. We would like to encourage adding different weapons rather via scripting and specific add-ons to them than having bazillions of pre-defined guns few people are likely to use and we cannot maintain quality control on them all.

     Modified all “Survive” missions to support new stacked handling of disabled saving
    </li>
   </ul>

  <li>
   Continued work upon soldier protection:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Slightly decreased collateral resistance of OPFOR soldiers’ extremities
    </li>
    <li>
     Decreased OPFOR advanced uniform protectiveness of extremities for it was too powerful. Still, it protects comparatively better than other uniforms.
    </li>
    <li>
     Set up specific protection values for BLUFOR Helipilot and Pilot coveralls. It will not save you much more than the standard uniform, but there is a certain difference.
    </li>
    <li>
     Set up proper protection values for OPFOR Officer uniform
    </li>
    <li>
     Range-master belt, bandoleer and chest-rig armor values set to zero (serving as just equipment holders)

     values, damage scaling rounds up, pistol ammunition damage adjustments and grenade tweaks

    <li>
     Adjusted explosives to maintain the protection of grenadier vests against explosives and grenades
    </li>
    <li>
     Minor changes in soldier equipment due to changes in headgear. Purpose of classes is not affected in any meaningful manner.
    </li>
    <li>
     Impacts of bullets cause soldiers to ragdoll a bit (flinch) even if they are fully absorbed by armor
    </li>
    <li>
     Decreased overall helmet protection values to increase significance of head-shots and general lethality of damage to the head
    </li>
    <li>
     Increased density of soldiers’ bodies to improve headshot lethality
    </li>
    <li>
     Because of the previous change it was also necessary to halve the explosion shielding of head hitpoint in general to maintain helmet protection levels for collateral indirect damage and explosions
    </li>
    <li>
     Fixed HE grenade from underbarrel GL weapon to match his RGO Frag grenade counterpart
    </li>
    <li>
     Elevated OPFOR collateral protection for hands and legs for the previous values were not sufficient to create meaningful difference between OPFOR and soldiers of other factions

  </li>

  <li>
   Tweaked: Ballistics of 105mm rounds and increased splash damage radius of 105mm HEAT-MP rounds
  </li>
  <li>
   Refresh support for advanced hint system. Calling of an advanced hint which is already shown just refreshes it instead of closing and opening it.

   Variable
   <em>
    BIS_fnc_advHint_state

  <li>
   Tweaked: Substantially increased damage but also decreased effective firing range of 80mm and 60mm unguided rockets
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: GL carrier rigs and their geometries
  </li>
  <li>

     Holding breath when diving made consistent across all presets

   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Optimized performance of 20 &amp; 40 mm grenade shells:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Scaled down impact damage of 40 mm grenade shell. It is still well capable to destroy MRAP wheels as it is supposed to. Splash damage remains unchanged.
    </li>
    <li>
     Scaled down impact damage of 20 mm grenade shell (so that impact is less powerful than a 20 mm bullet) by 50%, but increased splash damage by 50% (needed for GMG)

   hints when no Zeus owns the module

  <li>
   Tweaked: All supply (rearm, refuel &amp; repair) trucks and sling loadable supply containers (with exception of the vehicle ammo crate) are now effectively inexhaustible. However, fuel and ammo supply death explosions now destroy anything in their supply radius (10 meters). This is supposed to overcome issues with limited supply capacity and with repeated resupplying of the supply trucks and containers. All the respective scripting commands work as before, as the respective supply parameters were simply increased by several orders of magnitude.

     Increased splash damage radius and decreased deflecting and air friction to more suitable values to retain the performance against softer targets
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Performance of AA missiles because of inconsistency (ASRAAM should be a little less effective, Zephyr, Falchion and Sahr more effective)
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Decreased direct hit damage of 120mm and 125mm High Explosive shells for they were too effective even against heavily armored vehicles. Explosive splash damage remains unchanged though.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible.

   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible.

  </li>
  <li>

   <ul>
    <li>
     The 5.56 mm suppressor now uses the former LMG suppressor model which is more appropriate for this caliber
    </li>
    <li>
     The CMR-76 is now compatible with Stealth Sound Suppressor used by the Type-115 instead of a standard 6.5 mm suppressor as it is more visually fitting and available in all necessary camouflage variants
    </li>
    <li>
     Suppressors for CAR-95 and CAR-95-1 use the model of Stealth Sound Suppressor as well (beware, they are not compatible with Type-115 and CMR-76 due to a different caliber!) as it is more visually fitting and available in all necessary camouflage variants
    </li>
    <li>
     The LIM-85 can now attach sound suppressors
    </li>
    <li>
     These shorter suppressor models now add less inertia to the weapons they are attached to than the longer suppressors for weapons of higher calibers, which slightly benefits the handling of suppressed weapons of lesser calibers
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Changes in this hotfix affect Arma 3's net code, that is why we decided to raise the game version to 1.74 in order to ensure a smooth gameplay experience without network and compatibility-related problems.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible.

 <ul>
  <li>
   Contact consists of 2 data packs / folders:
  </li>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Contact (via PLAY CONTACT or -mod=Contact): for the singleplayer "First Contact" campaign experience (accessible only to owners - optionally loaded)

  <li>
   Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
  </li>
  <li>
   A Legacy Build Steam branch is available for advanced users. It contains the previous significant main branch version (1.92). It can be used to compare specific changes between major releases. The access code for this branch is: Arma3Legacy192

    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub

   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators, and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators, and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators, and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
