   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.

    Eden Editor:

    modules and functions
   </strong>
   (allowing manipulation of cameras, UI controls, objects, etc. based on a predefined timeline)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Improvements to the Edit Terrain Object Module:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Hidden objects no longer reappear in their destroyed state if destroyed
    </li>
    <li>
     It is now possible to:
     <ul>
      <li>
       Assign a variable name to a terrain object
      </li>
      <li>
       Execute global code on a terrain object (JIP covered)
      </li>
      <li>
       Execute server / SP only code on a terrain object
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     The attribute area was redefined to be divisible, UI controls/elements are now properly spaced
    </li>
    <li>
     An Object Variable Name attribute was added - as a result players can easily grab a terrain object and use it in scripts
    </li>
    <li>
     2 Object Init Code attributes were added (local and global) - code that is automatically executed after modifications to objects are done. This is useful especially for buildings that change object when they are changed to damaged or destroyed states.
    </li>
    <li>
     An Allow Damage checkbox was added
    </li>
    <li>
     The module settings design was simplified to be more consistent with other modules

   added)
  </li>
  <li>
   Tweaked: Improvements to the Zone Protection module:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Added possibility to define warning and execution expressions, codes that are called when a warning resp. an execution is triggered (if the code returns true, the built-in default behavior is suppressed)
    </li>
    <li>
     Default warning behavior was extended; if there is no HQ module for the player's side, players say a warning to themselves over the group chat
    </li>
    <li>
     The warning area width can now be set in the module's settings (values are Standard, Wide, and Very Wide)
    </li>
    <li>
     The module now works also with triggers that use
     <em>
