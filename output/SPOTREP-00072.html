  NOTES
 </h1>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Changes in this hotfix affect Arma 3's net code, that is why we decided to raise the game version to 1.74 in order to ensure a smooth gameplay experience without network and compatibility-related problems.
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider using the Steam client option to verify the integrity of the local game cache to avoid corrupted data after downloading this update.
  </li>
  <li>
   Consider defragmenting your HDD after downloading large updates.
  </li>
  <li>
   Updating a deeply moddable game and its platform is not without risks. We use various methods to communicate upcoming changes to our awesome modding community, such as via the
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/" target="_blank">
    Dev Hub
   </a>
   . We also co-operate directly on troubleshooting, and we offer an opportunity to test updates via our
   <a href="https://dev.arma3.com/rc-branch" target="_blank">
    Release Candidate tests
   </a>
   . Modders, server administrators and other members of the community do their best to prepare for updates and to address issues post-release as quickly as possible. Please be mindful of some interruptions (especially in the first hours / days after a release) while we all work to improve the game together.
